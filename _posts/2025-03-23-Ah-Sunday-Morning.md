Sunday morning, I heard this song played, in the majestic caffe room, then I realise how far I am from beauty love feeling. Man, I miss that feeling..

--

Georgia, wrap me up in all your 

I want you in my arms

Oh, let me hold you

I'll never let you go again like I did

Oh, I used to say

I would never fall in love again until I found her

I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"

I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

I found you

Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to

Love her once again

You fell, I caught you

I'll never let you go again like I did

Oh, I used to say

I would never fall in love again until I found her

I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"

I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

I found you

I would never fall in love again until I found her

I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"

I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

I found you
